                <h3 class="subhead"> Improving submission deadlines </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> Introduction: </b>
                    I am one of the lucky ones, but a few of my friends, especially the ones taking “Social Policy” and “Social Anthropology” had two (and maybe someone out there had three) deadlines due on the same day! Even though we know our essay deadlines beforehand and  even the question in some courses, but sometimes students are not the best at time management and an extra cushion to fall back on would be ideal. Another thing to note is that the deadlines for my friends included an essay for a compulsory course and a large popular SPS course. This is from the viewpoint of my friends studying Politics as a major, but the situation can be reversed and for those who study Social Policy or Social Anthropology as a major may find tight deadlines for their courses too. I know that it is impossible to ensure all courses to have different deadlines, but at least, for the most frequent and most popular courses within our Political and Social School we could have spread out deadlines, even if it is only 2 days apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What I will do: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Negotiating and collaborating with the course organisers
                            <ul>
                                <li> Each course have their specific plans and course organisers work very hard to ensure a smooth schedule for the course </li>
                                <li> If we want to change how things are done, firstly we would need to understand how the course organisers planned the courses and how flexible it is. </li>
                                <li> However at this stage I am not able to access this information nor can I make any further plans without first understanding the full scope of the situation. </li>
                                <li> The first step I would take is to survey the situation, possibly through a meeting with the course organisers in our school. </li>
                                <li> I believe that it could be possible since currently I’m taking an SPS course called “Africa in the Contemporary World” and the essay deadline for this course had been an unusual time which lessen my burden this semester. </li>
                                <li> My idea is to have some of the more popular courses to have this odd deadline too </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Due to the limited information I have it is hard to describe a more detailed plan, but the first steps I will take is understanding and analyzing the situation (hopefully get an audience with the course organisers) and negotiations. From one of the Reps Lunches I know one of the Deans are quite keen on this idea too so if things go roughly I will approach him with this matter.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subhead"> Improving essay feedback </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> Introduction: </b>
                    Currently there are many courses with efficient feedback loops however I wish to make this fundamental for all the courses in the school. In my own experience last semester, I've just got back my Final Assignment for my course “Understanding Public Policy” with some remarks I couldn’t quite get, so I emailed my tutor to arrange a meeting. However she went on a research trip and couldn’t help me until March. I don’t think this is her fault since she is a Phd student who have her own research to worry about to. I believe that I’m not the only one facing this type of problem. What we need here is to implement a system so that both students and tutors can communicate more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What I will do: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Promoting constructive remarks through training programme
                            <ul>
                                <li> It’s not quantity but quality of feedback that students are looking for. </li>
                                <li> It’s unfair to ask the tutors to write more remarks since they can only spare so much time on one paper, especially when the university have very limited finances to increase their wages. </li>
                                <li> It could be that the tutors are new to giving constructive feedback under time constraints, since they are students themselves and that teaching is not their main occupation </li>
                                <li> Tutors get 2 hours of public speaking training, many say they are willing to have more training </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By implementing a programme for writing good feedback, I hope to increase the quality of the electronic remarks. Maybe something similar to the programme EUSA currently provides for the Edinburgh Awards.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Advertising tutor availability with sign-up forms
                            <li> Not all students would take the initiative to contact the tutors but those who might wish to may feel uncomfortable personally emailing them </li>
                            <li> New tutors may not be aware of the feedback loop after returning the assignments back to the students causing schedule clashes </li>
                            <li> now that the school uses electronic feedback, students may feel less motivated to find the tutors for more personal feedback </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            By having sign-up forms students may feel more comfortable with approaching the tutor for remarks, this also better organises the tutor’s time with going over their feedback with the student
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>However</b>, this may turn out to be impractical, so after further surveying I may follow an alternative. Another plan in mind would be counter-feedback. After the student receive their returned assignments the student shall read the feedback and remark on the feedback. There can be an incentive for doing so such as the mark would not be finalized until the student submitted it. The idea is to ensure that the student has read over and engage with the feedback given, the student can also write if they think the remark is fair or not. Currently I’m still finding other ways to improve feedback.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 class="subhead"> Keeping an eye on the “Lecture Recording Project” </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> Introduction: </b>
                    Some candidates may have promised to push for all lectures to be recorded but I wish to inform you that they have not done their research well. The university have been doing some piloting work in this area, more information about this can be found <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/audio-visual-multi-media/lecture-recording-project">here</a> under the subtitle “New lecutre Recording Project”. In a nutshell, there is currently an opt-in scheme for lecture recordings through Panopto, however it would be compulsory for the upcoming semester. Plans are not set into stone so I will be keeping a close eye on it until it reaches our school, and when it does I will help with the implementation process and follow up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What I will do: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Keep an eye on the progress and update students via SPS letters
                            <ul>
                                <li> There seems to be a lack of knowledge about what the university is doing. </li>
                                <li> Due to uninformed students, there might be campaigns to change issues that have already gained recognition. </li>
                                <li> Since there is already an SPS letter I plan to add another column to it regarding updated news on student concern as well my progress with my manifesto  </li>
                                <li> I would also keep this updated on my website and facebook page </li>
                                <li> Actively seek out the progress regarding the lecture implementation so you don’t have to </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                <h3 class="subhead"> Communication with other schools </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> Introduction: </b>
                    As some of you may know, especially students who plan on being international lawyers, there had been a recent campaign since last semester regarding changing the courses for students who wish to transfer into International Relations and International Law. Fortunately the course had been amended so instead of having to complete all domestic law courses that are required from a typical law undergraduate, students aiming to be international lawyers in future years in our university can focus more on courses that fit their chosen career paths. It must be difficult to do a double major from two different schools but technically only belong to one school due to administrative reasons. I wish to facilitate students with double majors by establishing effective communication between schools so concerns such as the one described above can be solved easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What I will do: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Survey the existing communication our school have with other Social Science schools that helps provide joint honours courses (such as School of Law, School of Economics...)
                            <ul><li>In order to make change one needs to start with understanding the current structure, after which, a detailed plan can be made. </li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Establish frequent communication with the School Representatives of Schools belonging to the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Science
                            <ul><li>Even without knowing the structure from the school I would keep contact with the school representatives of other schools with monthly emails.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Seek to establish a communication system with other schools
                            <ul>
                                <li> Some students have wanted to do other courses from other schools as their outside course. </li>
                                <li> However the courses they were referring to belonged to the Edinburgh College of Art (such as Photography) </li>
                                <li> I will explore the current situation and see if there are any foundation courses that can be made available to our students (such as the foundation language courses from the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences) </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                <h3 class="subhead"> Dictionary policy </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> Introduction: </b>
                    Some second language students have told me about how they feel disadvantaged not being able to use a dictionary in exams. Previous policies required a letter issued by the personal tutor however this is no longer the case. Instead students have to get approval from the Student Disability Services through a Learning Profile to be authorised for a dictionary in exams. The information is avaliable <a href="http://www.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk/registry/exams/DictionaryPolicy.pdf">in this pdf</a>, which can be found under the dictionary section in <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/exams/exams-faq">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What I plan to do: </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Investigate the current system at the Student Disability Service
                            <ul>
                                <li> Find out the answers to the following questions regarding dictionaries </li>
                                <li> How hard is it to get approval from the Student Disability Service? </li>
                                <li> How many students have used this service to get dictionary approval compared to the amount of students using letters to get dictionary approvals? </li>
                                <li> Why did the university changed its policy for dictionary approval? </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the success rate for second language students getting dictionary approval is low, try and find out the likelihood of re-changing the system or find an alternative.
                        </li>

                <h3 class="subhead"> Coordinate EUSA peer proofreading sessions with essay deadlines </h3>
                <p>
                    <b> Introduction: </b>
                    For those who took “Introduction to Politics and International Relations” in the first semester would know that the essay which accounts for 50% of the final result had been due before peer proofreading services were available. This was meant to be a first year course so the proofreading service from EUSA would have been very helpful. This concern was voiced in the SSLC (Staff Student Liaison Committee) meeting but as an extra measure, I would like to keep track of it and make sure it gets implemented. Additionally I would like to check up to see if the other Pre-honours courses face this problem too
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> What I plan to do: </b>

                                <li> This would be a branch off from the deadline issue mentioned above </li>
                                <li> Survey to see if this is a school wide problem or only a slight hiccup in the system </li>
                                <li> If I am able to meet with the course organisers, this would be part of the agenda where I bring up the issue with them </li>
